When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Most of the time. That way, I can conveniently access my code from anywhere anytime with an internet connection.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I could be working on a feature that might not need updates from the remote or could even break my new functionality.
