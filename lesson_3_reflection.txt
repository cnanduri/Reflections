When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   Most of the time. That way, I can conveniently access my code from anywhere anytime with an internet connection.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I could be working on a feature that might not need updates from the remote or could even break my new functionality.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Fork is creating a clone, but staying within the realm of GitHub.
   Clone is creating a snapshot of the repository
   Branch is creating a label from a clone

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   1. Enables you to work on the latest code
   2. Prevents merge conflicts
