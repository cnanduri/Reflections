How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to locate the error instead of manually looking at each file simultaneously 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    1. You can document the changes done on the file each time
    2. we can reflect on the history and look at why a particular change has been done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    1. You save when the changes are meaningful

    Cons:
    1. You might forget to do the commit and might lose the data

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Helps track change done with regards to a particular function

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : Get the commit ids of the changes that we are looking for
    git diff : Get the actual difference using the commit ids retrieved from above

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Ability to revert to a working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
